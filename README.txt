We constructed the codes, where the simulation codes of regular, random, exponential, scale-free shared network are "regular_shared.M", "random_shared.M", "exponential_shared.M", and "scalefree_shared.M", respectively. Similarly, the four unshared networks' simulation codes are "regular_unshared.M", "random_unshared.M", "exponential_unshared.M", and "scalefree_unshared.M".

We also constructed the shared & unshared networks, "reg.mat", "ran.mat", "exp.mat", and "scal.mat" are respectively regular, random, exponential, and scale-free shared networks. In addition, their unshared networks are respectively "rega.mat", "rana.mat", "expa.mat", and "scala.mat".

Furthermore, initial species distribution is "initialspecies.mat".
